0,"We purchased an iPhone 7 that never worked properly from Day 1.  It could not maintain a connection for more than a few minutes making the phone unusable (the camera also did not work at all but that was minor compared to no connectivity).  We took it to our local Apple store and they would not work on it because they advised the phone appeared to have been stolen or cloned.  We contacted BuySPRY and explained the problem - they refused to exchange the phone, provide a refund, or offer any explanation.  After 4 weeks of dealing with the warranty company, we finally were reimbursed for a portion of the original cost.  Never use this company - go straight to an Apple store.  I would give this company zero stars, but you have to select at least one star to submit feedback."," January 23, 2020",Anonymous,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGGY7LR5ABQSIFPA7L2J4D67TBOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,8,3,0,0,"#63,277,988"
1,"Overall a great product. Came in almost perfect condition with a glass screen protector already on it. I did have to get the battery replaced, no big deal. Shortly after the battery was replaced the camera and flashlight stopped working. Apparently this is an issue with the iPhone 7s in general (that's a risk you take when buying a refurbished phone)... I was able to get it replaced as well though and I have a perfect working phone."," September 24, 2018",Kortney,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG45XIC7GKNYWOLN4BBWC77AA3OA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,37,12,0,0,"#2,469,715"
2,"This has been a great phone. It has a good sized screen, not to big but big enough for video and cames. Camera take good pictures, battery life is strong, bluetooth range is larger than earlier models. This was a refurb that looks and behaves like new.

3,"I want to start off with saying. People, don’t give things the benefit of the doubt especially after reading reviews.The company needs to rewrite their description.No, it doesn’t come in the original box nor charger. It DOES, however come with A charger. As a matter of fact. It comes in an android box??...Which can be easily looked over. IF THEIR WASNT A SCRATCH ON THE IPHONE. Their was more blemishes on the phone than I took pictures of. The only good thing in this purchase, was that it fixed one problem.Having a phone. The battery dies very quickly, at 10%"," November 30, 2018",Shawnte,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGWCP3BT4V6NV6HFHXALIU76QX4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,10,3,0,0,"#11,427,364"
4,"The product is listed as unlocked and available with straighttalk; it is NOT. I sent the first one back after the store rep told me it was linked to Verizon and the second one was linked to AT&T. Luckily they were able to resolve the issue for me at the store but it was such a waste of time! My interactions with the seller were not great, they did not seemed concerned with their errors and took their sweet time responding and getting a replacement shipped to me. I have been using the phone about 2 months now and am already having problems with the notifications glitching, the screen freezing,  and more recently my phone will randomly decline to make calls... I will probably be looking for a new one sooner rather than later, though my original plan was to keep this for at least two years 😠 Not a happy customer."," June 12, 2019",Shotsky21,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF3URFITQQEWEVCKJDPMKZDZXFGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,16,23,0,0,"#2,059,017"
5,"It was advertised as Verizon compatible it was not. We had to ship it back and that cost me $26.00 and this did not make me happpy This phone was misrepresented, so lesson learned read the reviews on the product before you order it .

6,"Overall, the phone isn't too bad for the price. It came already scratched up, overheats more than a normal iPhone (I've had tons of iPhones). The delivery process of just getting the phone was pretty stressful, I'm a month and half in using the iPhone and I called customer service to see if they could replace my iphone because it got to the point where my hands feel the burning from the phone... the lady was so unhelpful, bland and kind of rude. The return proccess would be such a hassle and leave me phoneless so I decided to keep the phone instead. All the functions work fine, it's just that the iphone started heating up the moment I got it. I don't usually write reviews no matter how good or bad a product is, but I've never received such bad service from a company, especially amazon sellers. I'm basically stuck with the phone, or be phoneless. I would recommend the phone, but just know there will definitely some things you need to deal with.

7,"When we received the phone it was in great condition and worked wonderfully. However, within a few months it began randomly dropping service which would drop calls. Then, the problem progressed until the service was dropped permanently. We took the phone to the Apple store where they explained there had been a ""manufacturer defect"" with the hardware and said they would replace it. When the replacement phone came in, Apple told us they found ""other"" issues with the phone and would not replace it. With no other choice (because the phone could not be used to make or receive any calls), we had to purchase another phone from Apple. Very frustrating."," March 31, 2019",Daniel Ales,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEI2NYD7HZ7O4BLYJ4TSOSIUTO6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,7,2,0,0,"#11,568,746"

9,"So the iPhone itself on the outside was good looking. Small scratch on the bottom of the screen. Software seemed to work okay but I only had it a few hours before I decided to return it. This is why: I went to test out the camera and it couldn't focus on something even when I tapped on the screen to tell it what to focus on. The screen when using the camera ""jiggled"" and my husband pointed out the clicking sound coming from the hardware of the device. Then I noticed the camera was shaking! Then we couldn't hold the phone because it overheated! So yeah it got sent back.

10,"After reading reviews on both ends of the star spectrum, I was apprehensive about the arrival of my first ever refurbished phone. I worried that it might be a lemon, but it exceeded my expectations! I was delighted to find a complementary screen protector and clear case included in my package. I checked the battery health right away and was happily surprised to see that it was at 100% peak performance capacity.  The exterior of the phone was unscathed and could have been mistaken for brand new. I continue to monitor everything to see if there are any quirks or bugs that will appear with time but, so far, I have no complaints. I'd recommend a refurbished phone to even the most skeptical buyer."," June 14, 2019",Peter,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFMTINCM4WSPN43DDVRUK5KK6AYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,14,3,0,0,"#40,425,552"
11,"Be cautious - if you have ANY issues at all, return phone immediately.  We got one for my daughter, paid $244 and it didn’t last 4 months. Seller will not replace/return as it is past 90 days.  She had intermittent issues with service connections shortly after receiving the phone. When it finally stopped connecting at all and we had it checked at the AT&T store, they told us it was an internal issue with the SIM card brackets that connects to the mother board. Basically causing a fatal error and cannot get any service connection.  I contacted the seller and received the generic “past the 90 day warranty” so there is nothing they will do about it.  We may try to have it repaired, but the repair shop is looking at $100 to inspect and possibly repair, if it can be repaired.  I guess that’s our expensive mistake, but at least we can warn others."," July 20, 2019",Amazon Customer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHMO2BJKUK2S54E37THKTI5UPJRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,7,6,0,0,"#6,041,555"
12,"Initially I was happy with the phone. It looked great physically and had no signs of wear and tear. However, the battery health was lower than I wanted; the phone said the battery health was 88%. However, I knew from the ad, that it could ship with as low as 85%, so I can't complain too much about that. The biggest issue with the phone that was an absolute deal breaker was that it frequently crashed and closed apps on me. Other times it would freeze up. Imagine having an emergency and having to make a phone call, only to find out that your phone decided to freeze up?! I have a family, so that's completely unacceptable. The phone also seemed to have connectivity issues and would not connect well with my wifi. It was slower than my other devices on my wifi and would sometimes freeze up. With the problems that I was having, I'm thinking it was a bad main board or ""motherboard"". The seller was MobileSpree. I contacted them and asked for an exchange. They refused to do an exchange and said my only option was to return it. I returned it with the shipping label provided by Amazon. However, even after 5 days of having the phone back, they would not refund my money. I had to get Amazon involved to get a refund. Overall, don't buy. It was a waste of time and money and a hassle to get refunded."," January 23, 2020",Dr. Dharma Jairam,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFJZOWS6OR7FZCUN4E6GOODAPQYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,37,40,0,0,"#1,299,747"
13,"The phone sent to me did not have battery life of at least 80%, it was at 75%. Furthermore, this model has an active recall and I had to take it to the apple store for them to replace the logic board so that I could actually use it. This was done for free, but the hassle was from being sent a product that may not have been properly checked as Amazon says it does for renewed products.

Then I tried using the camera app, but it glitched out every time I attempted to take a photo or record a video. I looked up the problem and the articles said to check Voice Memos to see if you get “Recording Failed - No audio devices found.” — unfortunately, I had this problem. The only good aspect to this phone was its look, nothing else. Overall, the phone is broke and unusable. I bought my phone from ElectroWireless; they ripped me off completely.

23,Device looks absolutely pristine. Functionally there are several issues. Battery life is quite poor and was clearly not replaced as part of the refurbishing process as I had anticipated which means I will need to pay for a replacement. The home button is extremely temperamental and works about every other time and every third or fourth time when attempting the double click feature. About Every tenth text notification will repeatedly chime until I actually open the text. Lots of little annoying things that I would not expect from a phone that had actually been refurbished. Pretty dissatisfied with advertising of product compared to actual functionality of product. I doubt this product was even serviced before being sold.Edit: included in my package was a slip of paper saying I could get a $10 amazon gift card for leaving an honest review.

28,"I've bought two of these, but not for a good reason... the first one I got from a seller named BuySPRY and unfortunately it looks like they don't repair the phones they work on correctly. I didn't really take concern about this until after I spilled a glass of water on my table, some of which went onto the phone. These phones are rated IP67 water resistant, but this particular phone repaired by BuySPRY was not properly sealed.If you do a little research you find these phones require you to remove all the old adhesive between the phone screen and the phone chassis and install a fresh new one; this is one of the primary things maintaining water resistance among a few other details. Anyway this phone clearly had not had its screen adhesive replaced, there was chunks of it exposed going around the edges of the screen - which left just enough of a gap for water to ingress.The big sad thing here is this happened I'm not kidding one day after the 90 warranty ended. I contacted the seller to inform them of the problem and asked if they could do anything. They didn't at all seem concerned their phone wasn't repaired correctly, nor did they offer any form of compensation for their poorly repaired device.So I ended up buying a new one, from a different seller named Hybrid IT. It has been over a month now and I so far have had a good experience. The first phone I got had a poor health battery as indicated in iPhone battery information. I contacted the seller about it; and they immediately corrected the problem. They sent me another phone which has a 100% battery. So far this phone has been perfect and I haven't had any issues with it. I also can clearly see the screen adhesive looks like it is brand new. Hopefully this one will hold out.Moral to the story, if you at all find anything concerning with your purchase of an Amazon renewed phone... don't hesitate, don't take chances... get them to make it right. Some of us are more picky than others, but my main concerns on repaired phones are the water tight seal and the health of the battery. It is going to be very difficult to find a perfect condition used phone, so you have to pick what you care about most.

32,"I dropped my old phone in the water when I went kayaking this weekend.  So I was in market for a new phone, went with the Iphone 7 for the best value and the water resistance rating of IP67.  It was sent to me with two day shipping, via USPS arrived in my mailbox. I had it set up with no issues through AT&T within 10 minutes.  THIS IS AT&T GSM ONLY PHONE.  Which was clearly labeled in the description.  A major concern for people is the how much has the battery been used or depreciated from prior use.  You can find this out in Iphone settings very easily.  My arrived with 91% of full capacity.  Which when you consider it is a 2-3 year old used/renewed product, that is great.  It came with an installed screen protector.  Which great because I also want one on there but have a lot of trouble putting them on without air bubbles.  Lighting cable and genic charger were also included.  Very pleased to have my phone back up and running on the first try.  I think that everyone is a little intimated about buying used phones, mixed reviews, bad reviews.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase.  I'll write a follow up review after I have had it for 6-8 months after having it to show how the battery and phone hold up.(Over a year later addition to review.)  This came with a screen protector applied which at the time thought okay the seller slapped on a cheap screen protector cool.  I have always used a otterbox defender series case because I am that guy, the guy who drops everything all the time.  I decided to lean up so as to be more comfortable in my pocket and travels.  I went with the Commuter series by Otterbox.  It took a drop after using it for about year, I thought that i had cracked the screen, when i felt the corner it had dropped on it had little sharp pieces of glass on it.  So i have been going with the thought process that i cracked the screen and the screen protector is keeping the screen attached and in tact.  So for the last serval Months I assumed that it was just a matter of time until the crack grew and the phone screen was eventually be on its way out.  Today i picked at the corner a little bit just to see what would happen.  As i pull up, it cracks further, as I look its actually all the screen protector itself.  It was on of those really nice like glass screen protectors that the seller or vendor had put on and it ended up saving my phone in the long run.  So that little extra ended up saving the day and when I bought it i didn't even know it was there for the most part.  Excellent thanks for have that preinstalled, who knows what could have happened if i had lagged on that."," July 3, 2019",Amazon Customer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGIPOAAQP6L6MPHH6PPM56GQR57A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,92,37,0,1,"#308,265"
33,I'm still within my 90 warranty from Amazon Renew.  The unit arrived well packed and I cannot find ANY blemishes or scratches on this iPhone 7.

34,"This phone is definitely worth the price. My phone came looking brand new without a scratch on the screen or the back. I know that some other people have reviewed phones that have come with scratches all over them, but mine wasn’t like that. It also has all the buttons and systems working perfectly, including the fingerprint reader. That being said because of the price that means you have to make a few compromises. My battery health is only at 85% so the battery does not last as long as a brand new phone(only about 5 hours), but it still lasts pretty well for me. Also the camera shutter sound cannot be disabled on my phone and that may be because my phone is from Korea or Japan where the shutter sound cannot be disabled. I thought that my phone would be coming with a lightning cord power adapter(dongle?) like other Apple phones because the wording in the description was a little confusing, but instead it came with a different cord. It also does not come with headphones so so I had to buy them separate. My phone also came about a week later than expected but I think that was more to blame on the mail shipping service. I would say that as long as you are willing to make some compromises for the price that this phone is worth it.

38,"I am LIVID.I purchased this product despite negative reviews regarding the quality of their phones due to more recent positive reviews, leading me to believe perhaps they'd learned from previous bad transactions to perform every necessary quality assurance test prior to shipping their product to the buyer.With this product being a PHONE, one would think the most basic check this seller couldve done would have been to make absolutely sure this phone was able to make phone calls.First, it took 3-5 ninutes just to boot up. It was stuck on the white apple logo screen that entire time, my first indication that I was mistaken for having given this seller my benefit of the doubt.Once fully loaded, I do that very basic test one does when they acquire a new phone - I attempted a phone call.There was absolutely no audio in the receiver and on top of that, the speaker phone button was greyed out and unable to be selected as an option.So I checked all the volume settings and tried it again to no avail.I restart the phone and still no audio.I googled the problem and much to my dismay discovered that this is a common HARDWARE issue with the iphone 7s and it requires opening up tbe phone and using a soldering iron on the audio chip; in other words, not a simple software solution I can perform myself.For the life of me I cannot fathom why after so many negative reviews regarding the quality of their phones this seller would choose to not do elementary quality tests before shipping to customers or why theyd send me a defective phone that I cannot use.

The sad thing about ""renewed"" products (as opposed to Apple's own ""certified pre-owned) is that the battery isn't changed out. JemJem is particularly guilty of leaving the product in a vulnerable condition.  Apple puts a will put a new shell and battery on its refurbs.Device's screen had noticable scuff pits but when the screen is illuminated, I don't see deformation of the graphics.  As soon as you put a screen protector on it, those defects will show...  There was an inconsequential scuffing on corners but that was tolerable.  Dirty too.  Damage was easily visible at arm's length.I fully charged the iPhone 7, disconnected the power and let it sit with no functions (no Wi-Fi, no SIM card, no use, screen off).  The battery stayed at 100% for nearly 3 hours...Within 15 minutes of web news reading (no video or animated ads, etc.) The indicator was down to 89%. The battery is a bust.The Apple battery condition indicated a MAXIMUM battery capacity of 80%.  Not a minimum. The description of the Renewed products made 80% sound like a hardline minimum.I see documentation that the refurbishment (renewal) was done 12/09/2019. Just short of 3 months of my receipt.  With a shut off phone, the battery drops to 0?  That's a bad harbinger!I guess you can just plan on taking the phone you just bought to the Apple Store and pay an additional $50 for a new battery...  I'm on a budget but stuck.Also, there was dirt in the ring silencer area and around the bottom speaker holes. I was grossed out and wiped it with electronic device cleaner. Groooooossss! The charger looked a little rough but my kid won't be putting that up to her face..This was my first Amazon and Apple (renewed) purchase...  Pretty disappointing. Having bought a handful of Amazon Warehouse Returns in past years, it was hit and miss. This was definitely a miss,  One final tip...  DO NOT BE DESPERATE like we were.  If I had an additional week to buy, I wouldn't have messed around and rejected this minutes after seeing the quick battery drop.*Update:  A few days have passed... Amazon will be getting a call...  This experience will solidify my distrust of their ""renewed"" program and the vendors involved..."," March 6, 2020",WeInSC,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGIZPJCD62ZLF7UW6EX4K2C6AYLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,762,197,0,0,"#19,862"

62,"I bought this product on May 30th this year. I wasn't looking for a top of the line product, and was expecting maybe a blemish or two.When I received the iPhone 7 I was happy to see that it was in like-new condition, save one small scratch on the metal ring around the rim of the device.It worked perfectly for about 3 and 1/2 months. After 3 1/2 months, it suddenly stopped charging, and then the phone died, and it still won't charge, and won't boot. I have tried all of the normal troubleshooting for this problem, but nothing works. The lightning port seems to be in good shape, and the device was never dropped, and never exposed to liquid or heat.I decided to look on Amazon for the return/credit policy but it just so happens that the Renewed warranty is a 90-day policy. I don't want to be a conspiracy theorist, but it feels a little too close to the timing of my device failure to be a coincidence. I feel robbed, I payed $231 to use an old iPhone for 3 months.I would consider changing my review if I was contacted by support with a replacement device, but as of now I am extremely disappointed and would not order from this company again."," September 27, 2019",Benjamin Marek,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHN7X5P446FOODQV66AQEDI6ZZEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2,2,0,0,"#13,895,602"
63,Im only giving it a three star because the item came in with a good exterior condition and i cam able to do normal functions with the added issue where the screen would randomly start selecting things after pressing the screen a few number of times (aka: play a game).  So i took it to a electronics repair store and they claimed that it needed a new digitizer so i looked up how much that would cost to  buy and it turned out that it cost as much as shipping it back.  So i just bought another screen assembly and am waiting for the item to come through.," April 21, 2018",amazon dude,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE3QIDBA3MHRQTRDAZMX6U77KZCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,6,8,0,0,"#12,996,106"
64,This is not certified refurbished but a used phone. The phone died yesterday after using it for a few weeks.

66,"I don't normally write negative reviews, because I understand mistakes get made, but this is a different story. I ordered a 128GB Jet Black iphone 7, when it arrived 2 days later it was actually a 128GB Rose Gold iphone 7. Not a huge problem, because I just needed a cheap-ish phone to replace my old iphone that broke.2nd issue, the battery showed at 66% usable life and needed to be serviced. According to the Amazon Renewed information, all phones will be shipped with a minimum of 80% usable battery remaining. Literally holds a charge for about an hour or two.3rd issue, discovered a dead spot on the screen at the bottom right in the middle, making it impossible to select anything. Again, Amazon Renewed states all phones are inspected and in full working order. Missing a large dead spot on the screen makes it seem like the phone was not inspected at all.Beware buying Amazon Renewed. I was given piece of mind by the guarantees laid out in the quality of the phones, however the reality is that is just not the case."," October 17, 2019",Jgolf249,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHUPYK6J2XS7KJBPGZ55M6PZJTLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2,2,0,0,"#13,610,042"
67,"I ordered 2 of the iPhone 7 128Gb phones. They were sold by HybridIT and fulfilled by Amazon under the Amazon Renewed guarantee. On arrival, phones were individually boxed with each box containing the phone in a bubble wrap sleeve, a charging brick (2.1A output), an approx. 3' usb lighting cable, and a sim slot tool.On initial inspection, the exterior of each phone was very clean and basically brand new looking. On startup one of the phones had an area of bad pixels that did not display dark colors correctly, but the other phone appeared to be in good working order. After contacting the vendor directly and receiving a response within minutes, I was sent a return shipping label and a few days later had a replacement for the phone with the bad pixels. The replacement phone also appears to be in basically brand new condition and the screen looks great. Will leave a detailed positive customer service review on vendor's site.Both phones are well within the Amazon renewed guaranteed battery life of at least 80% (one is at 89% and the other is at 99% according the battery settings in iOS).Although we use Cricket wireless, I bought AT&T locked phones because I know they work for Cricket and they were slightly cheaper than fully unlocked. AT&T also has a very easy unlock process if you need to unlock them. We placed our SIM cards in the phones turned them on and they are up and running with no problems.Bottom line is that these are very good phones for the price, even though we did receive one that was not up to par, it was taken care of promptly by working directly with the vendor. If this had not been the case, I at least took comfort in knowing that you have 90 days to return to Amazon if it does not meet the Amazon Renewed quality guarantee."," March 9, 2020",Craig,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFCQEDWONBDUJ36VHDQ3OSG67W6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,69,21,0,0,"#810,389"
68,"It only came with the phone and charger (no earbuds) but overall I really can't complain. It seems to be working as it should so far and only has a couple scuffs on it. Nothing super noticeable. Even came with a screen protector, so that was a nice addition. It's only been a day so far, but I'm pretty happy with my purchase(That was my originial review.. this is after dealing with the seller- I was having issues getting a credit they claimed I would be getting and this is their response to me)Good morning Sarah,We saw that your feedback was submitted just now and this is what we asked for in order to issue the credit of $10. You have decided to criticize us with your feedback while it is your own fault not knowing how to submit a review even though I have provided the steps to do so! We have issued more than 50 $10 gift cards to the customers who submitted reviews so far and if you go through the reviews you will see that no one is complaining about not receiving the credit except you.Good luck,JasmineMy Reply-Ok first off... it was not done JUST NOW! I had done this the day that you asked me to (8/1)... I actually have the e-mail i sent to you with the feedback email and I emailed you 3 times since then... this was NOT my fault... I was frustrated because I had e-mailed FIRST  saying I didn't see the place to do that.. THEN AGAIN I when I did see it, i responded the same day. With said picture.Then I sent a NEW e-mail because I was unsure if you were receiving the other 2... with another picture...And still did not hear anything back... Which is why I was frustrated... To attack me when I stated why I was frustrated is unnecessary.. I had actually changed my feedback review because I was frustrated with not hearing back, when the card you sent in your packages states I would hear at least SOMETHING in 24 hours... Looking back. I replied back to you on the 1st! the 1st!! this is the 7th... So yea...

69,"This phone looks new and the battery is phenomenal. Popped in my T Mobile sim and it was ready to rock and roll. Everything about this phone has been as expected EXCEPT the screen. Sometimes it works perfectly, but about half the time it does not. It doesn’t recognize the correct location where touching the screen. For example, I’ll try typing a word but it’ll recognize keystrokes from the other side of the keyboard. If I lock and unlock the screen a few times it will act normally.  I cannot find out how to reach their tech support."," March 15, 2019",Chris in TX,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH53AGN44T67YVX5W7ZBVKMFA3CA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,10,15,0,0,"#10,720,136"
70,"After reading both terrible and great reviews for this iPhone 7, 128GB, I decided to give it a shot. It arrived 5 days before it was expected, and was sealed nicely in its own little box (albeit not an original Apple iPhone box). The phone had protective plastic on all sides and came about 30% charged. The phone had 0 scratches whatsoever, SIM card slot and insert fit perfectly. No wiggling buttons, no obvious signs of (non-original) replacement screen, buttons, etc. Aesthetically the phone is 99% clean besides just a teeny scratch on the back. Called to my service provider and had the phone 100% operational within 20 minutes.The 1 negative point I would like to make (which was clearly explained in the product description) is that they only guarantee up to 80% battery capacity. Personally, mine has 88% battery life. Keep in mind, when purchasing a refurbished iPhone, you will have some capacity lost.For $200, this phone is spot on. I recommend to anyone!"," April 26, 2020",Connor McKenzy Hall,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHAA3LC5BDEDBXXKTLTRW5Q2PPZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,14,85,0,0,"#706,394"
71,"Purchased as a backup phone for my daughter, in case the touch screen went out. The purchase price is almost equivalent to replacing the glass on the iPhone 7. Battery life is at 80% when received. Her current phone is at 84% after owning it for several years so not much difference. The generic charging cable that came with the phone does not work, at all. The wall charger is generic and works. I threw the cable away as it would not charge any iPhone we have. It says ""accessory may not be supported"" when plugged in to the XR, 8 plus and 7. Overall everything on the iOS works as usual. It did arrive completely erased, but only with 3% battery charge. The back of the phone did not have any scratches. The glass has one small scratch, but not noticeable after a screen protector is put on. After the initial start up and logging in, I made sure to update the iOS so it is current. Everything else works as it should. Pricing fluctuates constantly on these, so keep an eye on the price before purchasing. If color isn't an issue, check pricing on the other colors as well."," June 15, 2020",Bandit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFJESAJLC3LB7ISSSG2K4N2JJ2UA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,177,110,0,0,"#230,028"
72,"I was in the market for a replacement iPhone for my 6S, in which the battery was on its last leg.  Not to mention I maxed out the 32GBs of space on it because of the apps I use for work and pleasure.  So, I decided to go with the iPhone 7 with more space and did a little research on Google.  Came across this seller, saw this iPhone 7 128GB unlocked and read the description and reviews.  After seeing many positives and the overall rating being high, I decided to take a chance and order it. ...  I was extremely impressed with the condition it was in when I received it.  It was beyond mint condition.  Not even a scratch or blemish on the screen or the back.  Nothing.  It was like it was brand new!  I was absolutely delighted!  I wish I had taken pics of it when I first got it.  But, trust me, it was beyond mint condition out of the box!...  The battery was at 86% when I received it.  I obviously expected this, as the seller clearly stated in their description of the phone.  Therefore, I don't know why some of the people in the reviews were complaining about this, when the seller clearly stated this in the description.  Although the battery life was so-so after I started using it, I decided to go to an authorized Apple repair facility near me that does 2-hour service and have the battery replaced for $49.  Now the battery is at 100% and my iPhone 7 works as if it's brand new from Apple!  So, overall, with the cost of my phone purchase ($188) and the cost of the battery replacement ($49), I ended up spending $237 total.  You can't beat the price for a used iPhone 7 128GB black.  I couldn't be happier!!  I definitely plan on buying another phone from this seller in the future.  I highly recommend them.  I would give them 4 stars because of the battery, but I gave the 5 stars because they were upfront about it, not to mention my phone was in nearly brand new condition.

73,"I purchased this from the seller “Kanga Supply”. Avoid them! I requested a phone with higher battery health and received a unit that was literally 81%. This is unusable. In addition, the charging port was disgusting and so filled with dirt and lint to the point that I couldn’t even plug in a charging cable. It took me 20 minutes to clean out the nastiness from someone else’s grime to be even able to charge the phone. How can amazon consider this “certified refurbished” when the phone is notifying you that the battery needs to be serviced right out of the box. Absolute waste of money! I am returning! Avoid Kanga Supply!!!!Side note, I have purchased from the seller Hybrid IT in the past and they have been amazing! I requested a unit with higher battery health and they sent it to me with 100%!

I would go from having great service one day, to all of a sudden no service for a day. It was very frustrating having to deal with this malfunction. I give this iphone/seller 2 stars because I was overall very disappointed with my experience and product. The thing about buying refurbished phones is it seems like a hit or miss.

76,"This phone is awesome! It came 2 days EARLY and it came with a charger and it came with 38% charge! Now, I read like 100 reviews that it wasn't unlocked, let me clear ALL that up, this phone IS GSM UNLOCKED meaning if you use a service provider such as Metro PCS or T- Mobile or other GSM service providers, this phone will work! Now if you use CDMA network( Sprint/Verizon) it might not work but that is not this seller's fault because VERY CLEARLY STATED in the product description this is a GSM unlocked phone. So don't buy it and expect it to work with CDMA Network and then write a bad review when it doesn't. This phone is certified refurbished through Amazon and it is like a brand new iPhone! Also, if you're switching from 6plus or 6s and below keep in mind that the 7 and up don't have a home ""button"" per say.. like it doesn't push in so the home button is not broken it just doesn't make that clicking sound the older phones make."," February 22, 2020",Yari,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGYDQOBAFKC5QONEDS7NSL4Z2OQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2,2,0,0,"#63,277,988"
77,"The phone arrived with one tiny scuff on the top edge, but looked great besides that.  Apple will charge you for that little scratch if you ever need to send it in for repair using the replacement program.  This phone has so many problems turning off and on on it's own.  Now it will not connect to my cellular service and confirmed to be a problem with the iphone.  This 90-day warranty is the only time period where this phone is sure to be usable.  After any iphone is 2 years old from brand new, Apple admittedly intentionally programs all Iphones to weaken and even become possibly completely unusable ""to save the battery"" according to Apple.  It is a total waste of money to buy an Iphone if you want it to last longer than 2 years from brand new.  Battery life is poor, phone breaks very easily if barely dropped, If an update is failing, you will have to use an apple/Mac PC to get the proper updates as it is intentionally designed to only work with other Apple stuff.
