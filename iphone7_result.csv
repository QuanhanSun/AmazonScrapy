0,"I’ve seen a lot of bad reviews for this phone based on issues with the seller. Granted, some of those reviews say it took a few weeks for the problems to appear so I’ll edit this if that happens, but wow was I happy with what I got. Not only did it come with a charger (there’s some debate on that in other reviews), but it even had a clear bumper case. That was neither expected nor necessary but I appreciated it (I bought a Unicorn Beetle case which I have used and loved before on other phones). There wasn’t a scratch on this phone and it started working right away for me. The battery seems to be holding up fine. All in all I’d say this seems like a steal. If it self destructs on me in the next few weeks I’ll update this.UPDATE: It's been a few months and a trip overseas since I wrote that initial review, and it remains a solid decision I'm very happy with."," November 29, 2018",Buyer of Things,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGGT5JVEBHJPWUG66AMFMALG6DUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"1,076",33,0,0,58951
1,"The iPhone 7 I purchased was ""certified refurbished"" and labeled as ""new"" quality but doesn't work. The phone looks great, but when I first turned it on it was in a restart loop. This was a bad sign to begin with, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and connected it to my computer. When I finally got it to restore to factory settings, the screen started glitching to the point where there was nothing to stop it, and if it did get to the startup screen, it was non-responsive.The shipping took a few days, but at least it came when scheduled.I have been unable to make contact with the company, but I will update my review if they are able to fix the issue and if I receive a working phone.Update: Ended up returning the phone and purchasing elsewhere. The company was cooperative with the return. Of course this could have been a one-off issue"," October 8, 2018",Alyssa Johnson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFEQLUMHLIC2WDH6PSTFCB4T6BQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,716,12,0,0,172112
2,"I am very disappointed!!! I've ordered and had success with a previous refurbished phone.  However, this iphone 7 with 128 GB was stated as unlocked, which it was.  It was stated that it was Verizon compatible.  It clearly was not.  The Verizon techs stated that the system on this phone had to be from another country whose systems are totally incompatible with US carrier systems.  We spent hours at the Verizon store just to have to purchase a brand new phone from them.  I watched.  They tried everything to make my refurbished work.  Very frustrated and never doing this refurbished phone thing again."," April 27, 2018",Pam Elkins,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE4JVDATNQEF4OMOTKVOWPKKYATQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,523,11,0,0,295139
3,"Returning. For one, it was not an unlocked phone. I've had it for a month and the screen has started going black every few minutes, and sometimes it freaks out and tells me I have no way to connect to wifi or cell coverage (despite being somewhere with wifi and usually 4G). I'm returning before the problems escalate.Note- it doesn't come with a charger or with headphones."," April 7, 2018",Rachel F,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGTX6XPN2VN36HN64CBDVLPASDKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,487,162,0,0,17705
4,"This arrived 2 DAYS after I ordered it. It came much earlier than expected which is amazing! I see many reviews that say it isn't compatible with different networks but it worked perfectly when I activated it with Sprint. And despite its price it works great! It's not slow and the battery doesn't drain too quickly or anything like that.

5,"First iPhone 7 order  arrived on time, had no scratches or any cosmetic damage, IOS not up to date and device screen started pixeling, really pretty obvious, even though box indicated it was ""Refurbished"" and ""Rigourously Tested"", ""Updated with New Software"".  After much discussion with hard to understand Amazon support reps, I negotiated an immediate gift credit, since I paid via cash on a debit card, and thus ordered a replacement the same day, while the first was sent back to initial supplier (DealFisher),  (Otherwise Amazon returns menu note suggested it would have taken 7 days to get credit).Second iPhone arrived a few days later from BUYSPRY, sooner than expected. It had a few very small nicks on the metal case, and nearly invisible hairline scratches on screen corner, and was not up to date on IOS, but did update. Seems to perform well so far (2 days in use) as expected after activating. Battery showed 85% capacity on IOS Beta Battery Health, but seems to hold a charge all day. Will give it a try and see what happens, have 30 days to return and 90 days warranty.

6,"It can sometimes be risky purchasing refurbished phones, but after doing my research I come to this product page and ordered the Rose Gold - iPhone 7 128GB from MyWit. Also trust and loved that this purchased is backed by the Amazon renewed program, so if there were any issues, I will be supported for up to 90-days after purchase.As expected, the phone arrived in non-Apple packaging with no headphones. What I was not expecting was that it also came with the Apple charging brick and cable. The phone looked GREAT, with no scratches (I would have been OK with minor scratches since I am purchasing something refurbished) and no cracks/smooth front screen. The only little, temporary, issue I saw was a little dust in the speakers/mic holes at the bottom of phone. It was a simple fix, I simply clean the area with a brush and the phone looked exactly like new! Tested phone calls on loudspeaker and the speakers work fine!I have used the phone for a while now and it continues to work beautifully. This iPhone 7 came with iOS 12 running out of the box, which was fine by me. Even checked the battery health with the new iOS and it was at 89% (very fair, actually expected something lower).Your experience (packaging, phone condition, etc) may not be exactly the same as mine since each phone is different, but this was definitely a great purchase for the price. Definitely be open-minded if you are interested in a refurbished phone and be OK if the phone does not arrive 100% in perfect condition.This is my personal review, I will update this review if anything else changes!"," December 19, 2018",Michelle L.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGG7RGHICVVMM76FQM3SBW4UJS4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,117,6,0,0,3546581
7,Awful. Paid $510 to get a defected camera that does not work. Would not recommend buying from this 3rd party seller. Every time I try to take a picture my phone freezes.

8,"I bought this phone amazon refurbished and paid a premium for it since I figured it would be a better quality phone that would perform like new. Boy was I wrong, anything you buy that says refurbished means it was once broken and will most likely still be broken when you receive it like in my case. They tell you they fully inspect the phone for faulty hardware but they don’t at all, if they did they would realize that the earpiece was blown and now I can’t hear anybody clearly when on the phone or when I play a video it uses the earpiece as a speaker and sounds horrible, the proximity sensor also never worked and my screen doesn’t turn off when I make a call, I am constantly putting people on hold because my cheek presses the button every time. The battery came in at 84% capacity so right out the gate it needed a new battery because the speed of the phone is lowered by apple if you have a worn battery. All of these defects were present as soon as I received the phone and should of been tested for. Buyspry will sell you a junk phone that looks nice but is unusable as an actual phone. Amazon just turns its back on this practice and defaults any questions or repairs back to BuySpry instead of backing their 90 day refurbished electronics gaurantee. The phone has numerous glitches with the software as well, all around I feel duped to have bought this phone and paid extra for the “amazon refurbished” seal which does nothing for you. Don’t buy, go to apple directly for refurbished phones."," February 22, 2019",Aldo M.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGDFOC4RSBAPHEVO3UCSO6Y2RNIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,67,11,0,0,1693485
9,At first it was perfect no complaints. The battery life was slow and died really quickly but I knew it was an issue with iPhones in general. By the next week it would die even if I turned it off I could get tops maybe 2 hours of life with it and then all of a sudden I wouldn’t have service for an hour then 2 hours then totally. I went to t-mobile thinking it was my SIM  and they really took their time to look everything over. They took out the SIM and it still said searching- confirming it’s the phone. Since then I factory reset it to return it and it still searching with no SIM (it should say no SIM) and I found out it turns on and off even when off which is probably why the battery life was so awful. When I went to return it you get a free label but you have to pay for it $17. I did read the instructions inside say to contact the seller for a free label. I don’t understand why I have to wait another 2 days for a label but hopefully they even answer. I will provide an update if the return goes smoothly.," October 31, 2018",Kira,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE6VSDMC45MH65RORDLZC7C6T3VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,84,15,0,0,1347320

Screen protector already on the phone, her SIM card went in and worked immediately, everything was good!

11,"In less than a month of receiving the phone, the side silence button/switch broke. I called customer service and besides the fact that the agent was very unfriendly and seemed confused as to why I would call about a defected product instead of going to get it fixed myself. She said I could return it for a refund. That would obviously leave me without a phone so I decided to wait and see if I could get it fixed at a shop for cheap (update: it's not a cheap fix). Now two months into having the phone, the phone randomly restarted overnight and became locked again. After calling my carrier, they (and a local phone store) said that the phone's contract must have expired overnight and the phone was turned off...so the phone wasn't actually fully unlocked. I keep trying to call customer service but even when I leave a message (as told to do so when the lines are busy), no one gets back to me. It's been a headache.UPDATE: I changed it up to three stars from one star. After one customer service agent saying they were simply too busy to talk on the phone and trying to explain what the problem was and how to fix it despite me telling them that I had already tried that and it didn't work, another customer service agent called me and told me they'd issue me a refund and then ship it back with a prepaid label after I was able to find a new phone. The phone did work with TMobile, as mentioned by other users, though the fact that the button broke less than a month after I received it was still frustrating. I do appreciate the last customer service agent's help."," September 5, 2018",Catholic W.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH7DW4SCYPKSC5U2QTN7WJ7R7EIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,81,3,0,0,2807919

There are two model numbers for iPhone 7s one that works with GSM and another that does not. This one is not supported by Verizon.

(IMEI, ICCID, or MEID code).  This can't be done unless you buy the phone first, not what you want to do.

24,"At first I noticed the phone's touch screen didn't work as well as my iPhone 6. Calibration was a little off, sometimes dead spots. I thought maybe it was a quirk of having a lot of apps transferred over so I just lived with it. Then I dropped it once, not a big drop. The screen didn't break, but afterwards the vibration became unacceptably loud. Then the second time I dropped it the screen cracked. Seeing as this was the result of my own clumsiness I ordered a new screen and vibration unit and went to work repairing it. When I opened it I noticed a screw was missing on the existing vibration unit. It became apparent this phone wasn't just a repackaged return, it had significant and sloppy repairs done to it.After that I wound up getting a brand new phone of the exact same specs, iPhone 7 128G and it is like night and day!

25,"This phone was not as described at all. When I went looking for a fully unlocked iPhone 7, I was specifically looking for an A1660 model, and that’s what the page said. When I recieved the phone it worked fine at first, but later in the evening when I was adjusting the audio from the phone, I couldn’t mute the shutter - no matter what I tried. I did some googling, and one suggestion on an apple forum said that Japan & Korean model phones cannot mute the shutter sound. They have privacy laws in those countries, due to excess upskirt photos. I went into the about setting in the phone and saw that the model number ended in J/A, a Japan model phone. Here in the US having your shutter noise not muted is socially unacceptable. I think it is dishonest advertising on their part, obviously a Japan model phone is going to be cheaper, because nobody wants that extra restriction, and they were charging just as much as other iPhones that were completely unlocked.

It came with scratches and one speaker didn't work. I thought I would keep it anyway, but then it had trouble connecting to tmobile, my carrier. After two days it connected and I had service. Then the phone died and again, it wouldn't connect to service for another two days. This happened every time the phone died or went on airplane mode. Until it stopped connecting altogether.

My callees repeatedly could barely hear me on speakerphone.  Even Apple support said it was not functioning correctly when I called for help with troubleshooting.  So, obviously the phone was not adequately ""inspected and tested by Amazon-qualified suppliers"".Amazon refunded the purchase, but for the hassle of having to test and diagnose the phone myself, a substandard warranty period, a ""less than new"" battery, missing headphone adapter, and a return, to me it's worth just buying the phone from Apple."," January 26, 2019",AveragePerson,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGKW5YZBB777BNCPLOPEUIUOUOGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,16,7,0,0,5496139

When I received the phone, I went to turn it on at the boost mobile store and he was able to give me a new sim card, (which I paid for) and a number. The boost mobile store guy then told me it was not picking up a signal and he tried updating the phone, and it did not work. He told me that it was a known iphone 7 problem, and I had to go to the apple store. I went to the apple store who first told me they would send the phone out (to I am guessing apples corporation because they could not fix it in the store) and give me a phone to use until I get mine back. Another lady then came to me and said since the phone was refurbished that they would send it out but the corporation would just send it back unfixed because it is refurbished, so they gave me another option to trade my iphone 7 in to them since it is in perfect condition and it is worth $250 off of whatever phone I buy from them. I then looked up the “problem” the iphone 7’s are having, and it says some iphone 7’s Apple has determined that a small percentage of iPhone 7 devices may show ""No Service"" in the status bar (even if cellular coverage is available), due to a component that has failed on the main logic board, the seller also lied and said thathe checked everything to see if it works, which he lied he knew it would be like this.

50,"Be cautious, this says Apple is the seller but once you purchase it will update the ""sold by"" line to a third-party seller (mine was called MyWit). That means you're not covered by Apple protections on a refurbished device. The phone I got didn't have it's battery replaced in the refurbishment. I had Apple run a test within a month of purchase and they said it definitely needed to be replaced (battery drained to 25% after using it for 3 hours) and it would cost $30 for a new battery (I eventually talked Apple out of this once they realized how I had been mislead, and how the refurbishment was done poorly). When I contacted MyWit for a replacement, they said they don't do replacements, but I could return the phone and buy a new one.

65,"Overall, the phone isn't too bad for the price. It came already scratched up, overheats more than a normal iPhone (I've had tons of iPhones). The delivery process of just getting the phone was pretty stressful, I'm a month and half in using the iPhone and I called customer service to see if they could replace my iphone because it got to the point where my hands feel the burning from the phone... the lady was so unhelpful, bland and kind of rude. The return proccess would be such a hassle and leave me phoneless so I decided to keep the phone instead. All the functions work fine, it's just that the iphone started heating up the moment I got it. I don't usually write reviews no matter how good or bad a product is, but I've never received such bad service from a company, especially amazon sellers. I'm basically stuck with the phone, or be phoneless. I would recommend the phone, but just know there will definitely some things you need to deal with.

Then, the problem progressed until the service was dropped permanently.

When the replacement phone came in, Apple told us they found ""other"" issues with the phone and would not replace it.

However, I knew from the ad, that it could ship with as low as 85%, so I can't complain too much about that. The biggest issue with the phone that was an absolute deal breaker was that it frequently crashed and closed apps on me. Other times it would freeze up. Imagine having an emergency and having to make a phone call, only to find out that your phone decided to freeze up?! I have a family, so that's completely unacceptable. The phone also seemed to have connectivity issues and would not connect well with my wifi. It was slower than my other devices on my wifi and would sometimes freeze up. With the problems that I was having, I'm thinking it was a bad main board or ""motherboard"". The seller was MobileSpree. I contacted them and asked for an exchange. They refused to do an exchange and said my only option was to return it. I returned it with the shipping label provided by Amazon.

87,"I've bought two of these, but not for a good reason... the first one I got from a seller named BuySPRY and unfortunately it looks like they don't repair the phones they work on correctly. I didn't really take concern about this until after I spilled a glass of water on my table, some of which went onto the phone. These phones are rated IP67 water resistant, but this particular phone repaired by BuySPRY was not properly sealed.If you do a little research you find these phones require you to remove all the old adhesive between the phone screen and the phone chassis and install a fresh new one; this is one of the primary things maintaining water resistance among a few other details. Anyway this phone clearly had not had its screen adhesive replaced, there was chunks of it exposed going around the edges of the screen - which left just enough of a gap for water to ingress.The big sad thing here is this happened I'm not kidding one day after the 90 warranty ended. I contacted the seller to inform them of the problem and asked if they could do anything. They didn't at all seem concerned their phone wasn't repaired correctly, nor did they offer any form of compensation for their poorly repaired device.So I ended up buying a new one, from a different seller named Hybrid IT. It has been over a month now and I so far have had a good experience. The first phone I got had a poor health battery as indicated in iPhone battery information. I contacted the seller about it; and they immediately corrected the problem. They sent me another phone which has a 100% battery. So far this phone has been perfect and I haven't had any issues with it. I also can clearly see the screen adhesive looks like it is brand new. Hopefully this one will hold out.Moral to the story, if you at all find anything concerning with your purchase of an Amazon renewed phone... don't hesitate, don't take chances... get them to make it right. Some of us are more picky than others, but my main concerns on repaired phones are the water tight seal and the health of the battery.

91,"I dropped my old phone in the water when I went kayaking this weekend.  So I was in market for a new phone, went with the Iphone 7 for the best value and the water resistance rating of IP67.  It was sent to me with two day shipping, via USPS arrived in my mailbox. I had it set up with no issues through AT&T within 10 minutes.  THIS IS AT&T GSM ONLY PHONE.  Which was clearly labeled in the description.  A major concern for people is the how much has the battery been used or depreciated from prior use.  You can find this out in Iphone settings very easily.  My arrived with 91% of full capacity.  Which when you consider it is a 2-3 year old used/renewed product, that is great.  It came with an installed screen protector.  Which great because I also want one on there but have a lot of trouble putting them on without air bubbles.  Lighting cable and genic charger were also included.  Very pleased to have my phone back up and running on the first try.  I think that everyone is a little intimated about buying used phones, mixed reviews, bad reviews.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase.  I'll write a follow up review after I have had it for 6-8 months after having it to show how the battery and phone hold up.(Over a year later addition to review.)  This came with a screen protector applied which at the time thought okay the seller slapped on a cheap screen protector cool.  I have always used a otterbox defender series case because I am that guy, the guy who drops everything all the time.  I decided to lean up so as to be more comfortable in my pocket and travels.  I went with the Commuter series by Otterbox.  It took a drop after using it for about year, I thought that i had cracked the screen, when i felt the corner it had dropped on it had little sharp pieces of glass on it.  So i have been going with the thought process that i cracked the screen and the screen protector is keeping the screen attached and in tact.  So for the last serval Months I assumed that it was just a matter of time until the crack grew and the phone screen was eventually be on its way out.  Today i picked at the corner a little bit just to see what would happen.  As i pull up, it cracks further, as I look its actually all the screen protector itself.  It was on of those really nice like glass screen protectors that the seller or vendor had put on and it ended up saving my phone in the long run.  So that little extra ended up saving the day and when I bought it i didn't even know it was there for the most part.

93,"This phone is definitely worth the price. My phone came looking brand new without a scratch on the screen or the back. I know that some other people have reviewed phones that have come with scratches all over them, but mine wasn’t like that. It also has all the buttons and systems working perfectly, including the fingerprint reader. That being said because of the price that means you have to make a few compromises. My battery health is only at 85% so the battery does not last as long as a brand new phone(only about 5 hours), but it still lasts pretty well for me. Also the camera shutter sound cannot be disabled on my phone and that may be because my phone is from Korea or Japan where the shutter sound cannot be disabled. I thought that my phone would be coming with a lightning cord power adapter(dongle?) like other Apple phones because the wording in the description was a little confusing, but instead it came with a different cord. It also does not come with headphones so so I had to buy them separate. My phone also came about a week later than expected but I think that was more to blame on the mail shipping service.

97,"I am LIVID.I purchased this product despite negative reviews regarding the quality of their phones due to more recent positive reviews, leading me to believe perhaps they'd learned from previous bad transactions to perform every necessary quality assurance test prior to shipping their product to the buyer.With this product being a PHONE, one would think the most basic check this seller couldve done would have been to make absolutely sure this phone was able to make phone calls.First, it took 3-5 ninutes just to boot up. It was stuck on the white apple logo screen that entire time, my first indication that I was mistaken for having given this seller my benefit of the doubt.Once fully loaded, I do that very basic test one does when they acquire a new phone - I attempted a phone call.There was absolutely no audio in the receiver and on top of that, the speaker phone button was greyed out and unable to be selected as an option.So I checked all the volume settings and tried it again to no avail.I restart the phone and still no audio.I googled the problem and much to my dismay discovered that this is a common HARDWARE issue with the iphone 7s and it requires opening up tbe phone and using a soldering iron on the audio chip; in other words, not a simple software solution I can perform myself.For the life of me I cannot fathom why after so many negative reviews regarding the quality of their phones this seller would choose to not do elementary quality tests before shipping to customers or why theyd send me a defective phone that I cannot use.

If your iPhone fits this timeline, you'll next want to match the model number. In China, model numbers A1660 and A1780 were affected.

They also sent a letter stating "" Our technicians carefully inspected the product you sent to us. They determined that the product is ineligible for service, so we're returning it to you now.

109,"This review is for the Amazon ""Renewed"" program product iPhone 7 256 GB gold phone sold by JemJem & Amazon Renewed...Battery was shot.  Came completely depleted of its charge.  If you Google information on lithium ion batteries, you'll find that letting it go completely dead is a really bad thing.  The sad thing about ""renewed"" products (as opposed to Apple's own ""certified pre-owned) is that the battery isn't changed out. JemJem is particularly guilty of leaving the product in a vulnerable condition.  Apple puts a will put a new shell and battery on its refurbs.Device's screen had noticable scuff pits but when the screen is illuminated, I don't see deformation of the graphics.  As soon as you put a screen protector on it, those defects will show...  There was an inconsequential scuffing on corners but that was tolerable.  Dirty too.  Damage was easily visible at arm's length.I fully charged the iPhone 7, disconnected the power and let it sit with no functions (no Wi-Fi, no SIM card, no use, screen off).  The battery stayed at 100% for nearly 3 hours...Within 15 minutes of web news reading (no video or animated ads, etc.) The indicator was down to 89%. The battery is a bust.The Apple battery condition indicated a MAXIMUM battery capacity of 80%.  Not a minimum. The description of the Renewed products made 80% sound like a hardline minimum.I see documentation that the refurbishment (renewal) was done 12/09/2019. Just short of 3 months of my receipt.  With a shut off phone, the battery drops to 0?  That's a bad harbinger!I guess you can just plan on taking the phone you just bought to the Apple Store and pay an additional $50 for a new battery...  I'm on a budget but stuck.Also, there was dirt in the ring silencer area and around the bottom speaker holes. I was grossed out and wiped it with electronic device cleaner. Groooooossss! The charger looked a little rough but my kid won't be putting that up to her face..This was my first Amazon and Apple (renewed) purchase...  Pretty disappointing. Having bought a handful of Amazon Warehouse Returns in past years, it was hit and miss. This was definitely a miss,  One final tip...  DO NOT BE DESPERATE like we were.  If I had an additional week to buy, I wouldn't have messed around and rejected this minutes after seeing the quick battery drop.*Update:  A few days have passed... Amazon will be getting a call...

118,"I ordered 2 of the iPhone 7 128Gb phones. They were sold by HybridIT and fulfilled by Amazon under the Amazon Renewed guarantee. On arrival, phones were individually boxed with each box containing the phone in a bubble wrap sleeve, a charging brick (2.1A output), an approx. 3' usb lighting cable, and a sim slot tool.On initial inspection, the exterior of each phone was very clean and basically brand new looking. On startup one of the phones had an area of bad pixels that did not display dark colors correctly, but the other phone appeared to be in good working order. After contacting the vendor directly and receiving a response within minutes, I was sent a return shipping label and a few days later had a replacement for the phone with the bad pixels. The replacement phone also appears to be in basically brand new condition and the screen looks great. Will leave a detailed positive customer service review on vendor's site.Both phones are well within the Amazon renewed guaranteed battery life of at least 80% (one is at 89% and the other is at 99% according the battery settings in iOS).Although we use Cricket wireless, I bought AT&T locked phones because I know they work for Cricket and they were slightly cheaper than fully unlocked. AT&T also has a very easy unlock process if you need to unlock them. We placed our SIM cards in the phones turned them on and they are up and running with no problems.Bottom line is that these are very good phones for the price, even though we did receive one that was not up to par, it was taken care of promptly by working directly with the vendor.

Sometimes it works perfectly, but about half the time it does not. It doesn’t recognize the correct location where touching the screen. For example, I’ll try typing a word but it’ll recognize keystrokes from the other side of the keyboard. If I lock and unlock the screen a few times it will act normally.

121,"After reading both terrible and great reviews for this iPhone 7, 128GB, I decided to give it a shot. It arrived 5 days before it was expected, and was sealed nicely in its own little box (albeit not an original Apple iPhone box). The phone had protective plastic on all sides and came about 30% charged. The phone had 0 scratches whatsoever, SIM card slot and insert fit perfectly. No wiggling buttons, no obvious signs of (non-original) replacement screen, buttons, etc. Aesthetically the phone is 99% clean besides just a teeny scratch on the back. Called to my service provider and had the phone 100% operational within 20 minutes.The 1 negative point I would like to make (which was clearly explained in the product description) is that they only guarantee up to 80% battery capacity. Personally, mine has 88% battery life. Keep in mind, when purchasing a refurbished iPhone, you will have some capacity lost.For $200, this phone is spot on.

122,"Purchased as a backup phone for my daughter, in case the touch screen went out. The purchase price is almost equivalent to replacing the glass on the iPhone 7. Battery life is at 80% when received. Her current phone is at 84% after owning it for several years so not much difference. The generic charging cable that came with the phone does not work, at all. The wall charger is generic and works. I threw the cable away as it would not charge any iPhone we have. It says ""accessory may not be supported"" when plugged in to the XR, 8 plus and 7. Overall everything on the iOS works as usual. It did arrive completely erased, but only with 3% battery charge. The back of the phone did not have any scratches. The glass has one small scratch, but not noticeable after a screen protector is put on. After the initial start up and logging in, I made sure to update the iOS so it is current. Everything else works as it should. Pricing fluctuates constantly on these, so keep an eye on the price before purchasing.

123,"I was in the market for a replacement iPhone for my 6S, in which the battery was on its last leg.  Not to mention I maxed out the 32GBs of space on it because of the apps I use for work and pleasure.  So, I decided to go with the iPhone 7 with more space and did a little research on Google.  Came across this seller, saw this iPhone 7 128GB unlocked and read the description and reviews.  After seeing many positives and the overall rating being high, I decided to take a chance and order it. ...  I was extremely impressed with the condition it was in when I received it.  It was beyond mint condition.  Not even a scratch or blemish on the screen or the back.  Nothing.  It was like it was brand new!  I was absolutely delighted!  I wish I had taken pics of it when I first got it.  But, trust me, it was beyond mint condition out of the box!...  The battery was at 86% when I received it.  I obviously expected this, as the seller clearly stated in their description of the phone.  Therefore, I don't know why some of the people in the reviews were complaining about this, when the seller clearly stated this in the description.  Although the battery life was so-so after I started using it, I decided to go to an authorized Apple repair facility near me that does 2-hour service and have the battery replaced for $49.  Now the battery is at 100% and my iPhone 7 works as if it's brand new from Apple!  So, overall, with the cost of my phone purchase ($188) and the cost of the battery replacement ($49), I ended up spending $237 total.  You can't beat the price for a used iPhone 7 128GB black.  I couldn't be happier!!  I definitely plan on buying another phone from this seller in the future.  I highly recommend them.  I would give them 4 stars because of the battery, but I gave the 5 stars because they were upfront about it, not to mention my phone was in nearly brand new condition.

Now if you use CDMA network( Sprint/Verizon) it might not work but that is not this seller's fault because VERY CLEARLY STATED in the product description this is a GSM unlocked phone. So don't buy it and expect it to work with CDMA Network and then write a bad review when it doesn't. This phone is certified refurbished through Amazon and it is like a brand new iPhone! Also, if you're switching from 6plus or 6s and below keep in mind that the 7 and up don't have a home ""button"" per say.. like it doesn't push in so the home button is not broken it just doesn't make that clicking sound the older phones make."," February 22, 2020",Yari,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGYDQOBAFKC5QONEDS7NSL4Z2OQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2,2,0,0,63277988
128,"The phone arrived with one tiny scuff on the top edge, but looked great besides that.  Apple will charge you for that little scratch if you ever need to send it in for repair using the replacement program.  This phone has so many problems turning off and on on it's own.  Now it will not connect to my cellular service and confirmed to be a problem with the iphone.  This 90-day warranty is the only time period where this phone is sure to be usable.  After any iphone is 2 years old from brand new, Apple admittedly intentionally programs all Iphones to weaken and even become possibly completely unusable ""to save the battery"" according to Apple.  It is a total waste of money to buy an Iphone if you want it to last longer than 2 years from brand new.  Battery life is poor, phone breaks very easily if barely dropped, If an update is failing, you will have to use an apple/Mac PC to get the proper updates as it is intentionally designed to only work with other Apple stuff.

129,"I began using Smartphones when homeless several yrs ago. Either Samsung or LG, & it was an ""Obama"" phone, or George Bush (receiving Food Stamps made anyone qualified). So having a connection to 911 was a really important utility. Nowadays my Smartphone collection has both one refined version of Android/Samsung, & another pretty cheap Samsung. I guess Apple has been known to provide Tier 1 software & updates, so buying my iPhone 7 was because I finally decided an American company (although assembly for iPhones takes place largely in China) might handle private data in a more understandable way. Software updates for this old version won't last that many more years, but the price of the ""renewed"" phone is also worth the more exact manufacturing result (the touch-screen really is user friendly), & anyone will like aluminum cases. Android software has a lot of programmers & I don't think they are as easily integrated; Samsung needs a lot of user data just to enable you to do some important things with its Android, so like Windows, each company interfaces with one another easily or not so much.

138,"A couple thoughts on this item. I received it a day early than expected so the shipping was great. It didn't come in an original iPhone box however it wasn't damaged in any way. The condition was perfect. I was pretty happy with it. Put in a Verizon sim and it picked up the Verizon network pretty much immediately. Then put it on charge to charge up and updated the operating system.This is when things went south. The battery ran super hot when charging. A lot more hot than normal. I then tried typing in the phone's IMEI number into Verizon's website and was told that the phone is not compatible with Verizon. I did this more than once just to make doubly sure I had typed it in correctly.I then tried to make a call. The call quality was terrible. At times it was impossible to hear anything. It didn't matter if the call was on speaker or not. I tried restarting the phone and got pretty much the same result. When trying to make a call, it spoke a lot about roaming. This was key. I turned the roaming option off and tried again. Still talking about roaming.This phone was not 100% unlocked. It was probably locked to a network such as AT&T or T-Mobile at some stage, however it lacks the antenna which will allow it to connect to other networks such as Verizon or Sprint. A phone which is 100% unlocked will have antenna built into it which support all the networks making it a fully unlocked phone. The phone did pick up Verizon, however that was based on roaming on some other network and not by connecting directly to any Verizon tower in my area.A fully unlocked phone would have shown on Verizon's website that the IMEI number was compatible with their network. It would have also come back as being compatible with AT&T's network as well as T-Mobile and Sprint. It would have saved me time and money if the IMEI number was checked by the seller as to whether it was compatible with the Verizon network instead of running an unlock code on the phone and then marketing it as being fully unlocked.I checked the IMEI number. It came back clean however it does show that it comes from a phone which has 128 GB of storage. This phone has 32 GB of storage, so somewhere there is a discrepancy.

I wasn't used to using an iPhone, but was used to using my Android … It seems there's however many advantages to having an iPhone and having 128 GB is going to help me out a lot, as it seems I was always having to deal with space shortage on my 8GB Android, in terms of having to delete and reinstall apps in order to install other apps … And on my Android, I was unable to figure out how to make full use of the SD card; so even though I had an SD card installed, I was always running out of space when there was maybe plenty of room left on the SD card … With the 128GB, hopefully I won't have to even consider placing an SD card in the iPhone … It appears that I received a good iPhone sent to me ,,, Thank goodness! … I've only looked it over and checked it out as of last night and the person at my network service only looked at it briefly and told me it was a good one; and from all appearances in the short amount of time I've checked it out, it appears to be a good one! … Hopefully I won't need to do any updates to the 5-star I've given it … Hopefully my experience with it remains positive … Thank you for taking such care to make sure it was in good shape before sending it! … I guess I was a bit worried after I had read different negative reviews, but I also read different positive reviews … I read the reviews AFTER I had sent for the iPhone … Maybe it's good that I didn't see the negative reviews BEFORE sending for it because I might have hesitated and maybe I wouldn't have sent for it … But I'm glad I sent for it, as it appears to be a good one! … Thank you!"," February 28, 2020",Amazon Customer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFJN2GJFKCT3AVE7TQJZJJU6DVHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,6,3,0,0,16666162
147,"Important manufacture update at the bottom!! (only reason I didn't give it five stars)Just got this product today! Came in perfect condition, honestly way beyond my expectation. All the buttons work, the silent/loud switch is in good condition (can visibly see it a little worn) but it works fine! So far nothing wrong with this phone, I’m really happy and satisfied with this iPhone, there’s nothing wrong cosmetically or with the functionality of the phone!One week update:Battery works 100% fine, definitly an upgrade from my previous Iphone 6. Still an iPhone battery (will last all day, but dont expect more)ALSO IMPORTANT!: This is a China made phone, they do have restrictions on the SHUTTER SOUND on the camera!! There is no muting it with the phone on or off silent mode! The only way to take a silent photo is using the ""Live"" photo mode in the camera. It will still make a little ""beep"" when finished capturing. Its one minor flaw to get such a good phone at a decent price.

According to apple models A1660 should not have been resold when apple pulled them from the shelf. 2 weeks after the 90 return policy (of course) my son's phone began exhibiting the classic issues directly related to the recall. When inquiring/appealing with the seller they told us there was nothing they could/would do and suggested we take it to a local repair store. Super discouraging.

That said, if I replace it at the Apple Store for $40, it will almost be like new!Not bad for $200.."," August 11, 2019",Jeffrey I Butler,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEEPUNEOYAF3UA45YEOP4JP2RVSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,3,1,0,0,13582173
176,"No! Despite 2 session with Verizon and 2 with Apple consultant, and repeated attempts to get an appointment at the Apple Store I Ended up spending a week trying to get this phone, that looked great and was advertised  as being suitable for Verizon, to work. Finally mailed the phone to Apple and got the phone back 6days later with a note saying that I needed to take it to an Apple Store, no explanation. Another week to get appointment. 2 hours at Apple store, they said phone was corrupted. In frustration ended up buying new Phone that day. Have bought other rebuilt phones that worked fine, for years. Lots of hassle and time. No cell phone for 2/12 weeks. $424 extra dollars. Not so great"," September 22, 2020",marsha d fine,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGJ5ATTYJOEPM5WEPZFBOR2NKF6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,7,37,0,0,77062575
177,"this item was 115 days from purchase when it began shutting off and unable to connect to cell provider, many calls to their support team and reloading, wiping, updating to iOS13 and then updating to iO#13.1, tried every single technique from removing sim to complete wipe and still only connects to for one to two minutes before entering a searching for signal loop -BEWARE- not all refurbished are in for just a battery replacement or scratched up screen"," September 26, 2019",davidb,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFMMFHFDMYAVUG2IBEBEGIYIK5QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,15,52,0,2,2295168
178,"I bought this phone on 5/11/20. Today it is 9/24/20. The battery was never great but I could live with it. For the last month it has been getting worse and worse and of course I'm out of the 90 day warranty period. At first I thought maybe an update would fix it. NOPE. Maybe background apps are sucking my battery? Nope. hotspot usage? bluetooth? No. The battery just sucks. It gets down to about 30% and it dies. It dies suddenly and without apparent cause. Something happens around 30% to make it drain quickly to 0. It doesn't even warn me that the power is low. When I bought the iphone, the Max Capacity was 84%. Now it's 56%. gr."," September 24, 2020",saralee,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGON3XO2X6NLJBWQKKL3AU7P57KA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,54,98,0,0,4371486
179,I ordered this phone on Wednesday for my 10 yr old son as a gift. I received it on Friday. It did not work. I spent an hour on the phone with ATT customer service trying to troubleshoot it with no success. They advise me to take it to the ATT store which i did all in the same day of receiving it. They provided me with a new prepaid chip and it STILL did not work. So I am returning this phone today via FedEx. Extremely disappointed and so was my son.," May 11, 2020",Mz_Brownie,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHHMQ4ZBO675262ITTPBAKSKHWOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2,8,0,1,7093077
180,"iPhone did not work. It kept saying No Service. Never experienced that before, so we went to apple. Apple said the phone is damaged and unable to be fixed. If I give them $319 they would replace the phone. I was to upset. I gave to my son for his 15th birthday, it never worked. Thankfully Amazon did give me my money back. This is my first time buying from this seller so I’m not sure if this normal. Facts, I bought a defective phone. Seller may or may not have known. It’s alot of money to lose though so I’d suggest you think twice before purchasing. Been with Amazon over 10 years first time u ever had a problem."," August 17, 2019",Nina Phillips,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFZWYGXRHKX6IJTLIODND3SQSTMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,3,4,0,0,14626541
181,"I had purchased a fully unlocked iPhone 7 as a Christmas gift for a friend.  I added him to my MetroPCS account.  He has had it for approximately three months now.  The issues started early February 2020 where he could no longer add apps, then the battery started losing charge and now he cannot use the phone at all because is shows on the screen Locked SIM.  After contacting MetroPCS they said I need to contact Apple which was a nightmare.  I’m not sure if others have had the same issue with this Amazon approved vendor before, but I will not order from them again.  If there are others who have had a similar experience to let Mr. Bezos know of their situation and urge him to eliminate the supplier."," March 23, 2020",Mark Haddix,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFI3P6YUPWUZCQVNO5GEOKQLBOPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2,1,0,0,63277988
182,"I ordered an iPhone 7 for my mom as a quick replacement for her older iPhone that was no longer holding a charge. After emailing the seller about the shipping delays, the phone finally arrived. Upon inspection of the phone the first thing I noticed was a long scratch on the back of the phone. Not a big deal, it’s refurbished. The SIM card tray jutted out a bit and after looking online at images of iPhone 7’s, I figured out this wasn’t apart of the design, red flag but it didn’t affect the performance of the iPhone from what I could tell. The phone needed to be updated, once again no big deal. But for someone who wants a phone that’s ready to use, the update time might be an issue.Now I will get to my 2 star rating. As I’m setting up the phone for my mother, I noticed it was running really hot on the back upper part of the phone, opposite the camera. A software update and transferring data could cause this so I set the phone to the side to cool off a bit when I was done. Two days later and the phone barely keeps a charge. This problem with the old phone was the reason I bought this iPhone 7. Needless to say I will be returning this product. It could just be a defective one out of the bunch."," June 10, 2020",Kristen N.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGEHP2UP4ZJNI76SBFYKHHZJJ5CA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,31,11,0,0,2127299
183,Received this phone with 61% battery capacity life. The first day I received this phone it had trouble connecting to my chargers. I even bought a brand new Apple charger and wall plug to see if that was the problem. Not even within a month of owning the phone it stopped connecting and charging completely and died on me. It would die on me even at 20% and would be so laggy. It would come on and off and did not give me enough time to delete any of my info from the phone to return it. The seller told me to return the phone and give them my passwords?! I am so disappointed. They also made me go out of my way to buy a battery and they reimbursed me but they sent it to my CREDIT CARD?? When I bought the battery with my DEBIT. Not credit card... Amazon won’t help me with any of this either. I don’t have access to a computer to delete through the iCloud either. I don’t understand why they can’t just refund me my money. It’s not fair to me to give them my passcode for them to have access to all of my private and personal information.," August 4, 2020",Kimberly,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFFGBYDSJ5SCTTFBXA4CIULEZLUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,1,1,0,0,63277988
184,"I’m very picky with my phone cases which means I keep buying them until I find one that’s jut right. This phone case has everything I’m looking for. It’s not to bulky and has a slim fit. It’s enclosed and has a built in screen protector. The front plastic trim doesn’t cover top and bottom front of the Like some cases making the screen “appear” smaller.The rubber is stiff and durable and not like those cheap ones the stretch out over time.One reviewer stated they had to keep taking it apart to get the moister out. Well this is NOT a waterproof case and if it was it would be heavier and bulkier. I’m wondering how that much moister is getting in ther in the 1st place. Are you bathing with it? Tip: instead of drenching the phone with cleaning solution then wiping it up, try spraying the cleaning solution on the rag itself (just enough to coat it) then use that to clean the screen.Another reviewer stated the back falls off. If you don’t snap it in correctly this will happen. Solution: go to an arts and crafts store or fabric store and ask for some double sided hem tape. It’s very thin and extremely strong. It will keep that back on if it’s a defect."," September 25, 2020",Lauren Vines,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AESP33GW2XEA22GA32JBAQZUQSBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,14,9,0,0,44677552
